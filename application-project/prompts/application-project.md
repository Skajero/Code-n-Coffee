## Book Cafe Project
---

You have been tasked as a Developer to create an application for a bookshop. The bookshop has a small cafe that serves drinks, a selection of foods, and a good selection of bestselling books. 
The cafe also has a book delivery service, where they can deliver books directly to their customerâ€™s door! 
The owners of the cafe have requested that an application be built to showcase a list of their menu and book items. 
The application should have an option for customers to choose their food and drinks items and/or books items. There should also be an option for employees to update the menu/book items, 
update or add any specials, or view customer details (so they know who, what, and where to send the items to!).

When you finish writing your application, you will present the program to the rest of the class. The presentation does not need to be more than 10 minutes. 
In your presentation, include the following:

- Walk everyone through your program. How does it work? Show examples of how it runs.
- Explain what you have used in your code! Be proud to show off your work!
- What was your favorite part of the project?
- Did you learn anything new while doing this project? If so, what was it?
- What sort of challenges did you and your group encounter? How did you overcome these challenges?
- If you had more time, what would you do to improve your code/build on it?

I would like to hear from every group member in the presentation, so please coordinate accordingly.  

Use your Python knowledge to create an application that can help the above client. Although it is up to you to decide how to build this, try and use all of the knowledge and skills you have learned over the module. Work together with your group to build a program. When you are finished, your group will present the application to the rest of the class. Good luck!

| **Functionality**                     | The program fully meets all requirements and exceeds expectations.                                      | The program meets all requirements and functions well.                                           | The program mostly meets requirements but may have minor issues.                                | The program lacks key features or has significant issues.                                  |
| **Code Structure and Organization**   | Code is well-structured, organized, and follows best practices.                                         | Code is organized and follows generally accepted coding practices.                               | Code structure is acceptable but may lack consistency or clarity.                               | Code structure is confusing or poorly organized.                                           |
| **Use of Appropriate Variables and Names** | Variables and names are well chosen, meaningful, and follow naming conventions.                          | Most variables and names are appropriate, but there may be some room for improvement.             | Some variables and names are unclear or inconsistent.                                           | Variables and names are confusing or poorly chosen.                                        |
